Abstract

Current trends of global climate change affect marine ectothermal animals not only through the increase in ambient temperature. Synergistic effects of carbon dioxide and temperature changes as well as more frequent hypoxia events must also be considered. As a first attempt, the combined effects of warming and elevated CO 2 concentrations were investigated in the edible crab (Cancer pagurus). Arterial oxygen tension (PaO 2 ) in the haemolymph was recorded on-line during a progressive warming scenario from 10 to 22°C and cooling back to 10°C. Hypercapnia (1% CO 2 ) caused a significant reduction of oxygen partial pressure in the haemolymph as well as a large, 5°C downward shift of upper thermal limits of aerobic scope. The present findings are the first to show that hypercapnia causes enhanced…
