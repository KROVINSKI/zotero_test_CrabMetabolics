Description
Increased anthropogenic input of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere has caused widespread patterns of ocean acidification (OA) and increased the frequency of extreme warming events. We explored the sublethal effects of OA on the hemolymph chemistry and physiological response to acute thermal stress in the American lobster ( Homarus americanus H. Milne Edwards, 1837). We exposed subadult lobsters to current or predicted end-century pH conditions (8.0 and 7.6, respectively) for 60 days. Following exposure, we assessed hemolymph L - lactate and calcium concentrations (as indicators of oxygen carrying capacity), ecdysterone concentrations, total protein content, and total hemocyte counts (THCs) as an indicator of immune response. We also assessed cardiac performance in the context of an acute warming event using impedance pneumography. Calcium, total protein, and ecdysterone …
